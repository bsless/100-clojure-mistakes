# What is this?

An experiment inspired by [100 Go Mistakes](https://100go.co/)

# Why

I hope it's a good idea

# Contribution

Please :)

Such a thing should be a community effort.

The easy part is adding mistakes to the list. Harder:

- Project structure
- Code organization
- Presentation

I thought about using Clerk for it, but doing it well would depend on
good project structure, I believe.

How can this be optimized for contribution? A single file is probably a
bad idea. Better ideas are welcome
